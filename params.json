{"name":"Trollcount","body":"Trollcount is a simple scala library which simulates the [troll] numeral system[*] according to the [Discworld]. It allows it's users to create troll numbers and to add them to each other. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> import se.diversify.trollcount.TrollNumber._\r\nimport se.diversify.trollcount.TrollNumber._\r\n\r\nscala> val one = One\r\none: se.diversify.trollcount.TrollNumber = One\r\n\r\nscala> val three = Three\r\nthree: se.diversify.trollcount.TrollNumber = Three\r\n\r\nscala> three.value\r\nres0: Int = 3\r\n\r\nscala> val five = Many-One\r\nfive: se.diversify.trollcount.TrollNumber = Many-One\r\n\r\nscala> val ten = five + five\r\nten: se.diversify.trollcount.TrollNumber = Many-Many-Two\r\n\r\nscala> val fourteen = Many-Many-One + Many-One\r\nfourteen: se.diversify.trollcount.TrollNumber = Many-Many-Many-Two\r\n\r\nscala> fourteen.value\r\nres1: Int = 14\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis library exists in three branches:\r\n \r\n * **master** - *The complete library.* Use this branch if you want to see my implementation.\r\n * **tests-only** - *Only contains tests and no implementation.* Use if this branch if you want to implement \r\nthe whole library logic on your own.\r\n * **tests-and-stubs** - *Contains stub implementations and failing tests.* Use this branch if you want to \r\nbootstrap your implementation and add the missing bits.\r\n\r\nTo get the code, run:\r\n    \r\n    git clone git://github.com/uzilan/trollcount.git\r\n\r\nTo switch to a different branch, run:\r\n    \r\n    git checkout master\r\nor...\r\n    \r\n    git checkout tests-only\r\nor...\r\n    \r\n    git checkout tests-and-stubs\r\n[*] the [troll] numeral system goes like this:\r\n    \r\n```\r\nOne, Two, Three, Many,\r\nMany-One, Many-Two, Many-Three, Many-Many,\r\nMany-Many-One, Many-Many-Two, Many-Many-Three, Many-Many-Many,\r\nMany-Many-Many-One, Many-Many-Many-Two, Many-Many-Many-Three, Lots\r\n```\r\n\r\n[troll]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(Discworld)\r\n[Discworld]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld","tagline":"Lets you count like a troll","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
