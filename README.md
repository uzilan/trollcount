Troll Count
===========

An simple scala program which simulates the [troll] numeral system according to the [Discworld].

This program exists in three branches:
 
 * **master** - *The complete program.* Use this branch if you want to see my implementation.
 * **tests-only** - *Only contains tests and no implementation.* Use if this branch if you want to implement 
the whole program logic on your own.
 * **tests-and-stubs** - *Contains stub implementations and failing tests.* Use this branch if you want to 
bootstrap your implementation and add the missing bits.

To get the code, run:
    
    git clone git://github.com/uzilan/trollcount.git

To switch to a different branch, run:
